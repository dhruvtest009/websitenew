    <h2>Behind the Ink</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> I'm a heartbroken engineering student who started writing two years ago.</li>
        <li> Keeping a diary felt messy‚Äîand dangerous. So I turned to Instagram.</li>
        <li> Writing started as a nightly task but turned into a sacred ritual.</li>
        <li> My poems come from daily experiences, racing thoughts, and overthinking.</li>
        <li> Lesson learned: not everyone deserves your love or trust.</li>
        <li> I‚Äôve learned to protect myself‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs safer that way.</li>
    </ul>

        <li> Singing and gardening help me stay grounded.</li>
        <li> Espresso (double shot) is my soulmate.</li>

        <h3>Echoes of Melancholy</h3>
        <p>In the echoes of our old conversations,<br />
        I find a melancholy melody,<br />
        A symphony of the way I used to think of you,<br />
        A ballad of lost butterflies and silent pleas.</p>

        <p>In the soft glow of our texts, now silent,<br />
        Words linger like ghosts of laughter<br />
        The cadence of our shared jokes,<br />
        Fading into the hollow spaces of my heart.</p>

        <p>Your smile, once a sunbeam that danced,<br />
        Now a distant memory, a ghostly waltz,<br />
        Gave birth to butterflies that fluttered,<br />
        Now trapped in the cage of time's ruthless grasp</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="poem-card">
        <h3>Silent Promises</h3>
        <p>They say sometimes we miss the bond,<br />
        Not the person, yet here I am,<br />
        Longing for the echo of your laughter,<br />
        The ghost of your presence, haunting my soul.</p>

        <p>I sacrificed sleep on the altar of our connection,<br />
        A nocturnal offering to the gods of love,<br />
        Yet in the darkness, I found only emptiness,<br />
        A void that no amount of words could fill.</p>

    <p>Eagerly waiting for a reply that never came,<br />  
        I stood on the shores of hope,<br />
        Watching the waves of anticipation,<br />
        Crash against the cliffs of reality.</p>

      <div class="poem-card">
        <h3>Linger in Shadows</h3>
        <p>The past, an unyielding anchor,<br />
        Refusing to release its grip,<br />
        No matter how I try to sail away,<br />
        I am tethered to the memory of you.</p>

        <p>No matter how far I journey in life,<br />
        Your ghost accompanies me,<br />
        A silent companion in the theater of my mind,<br />
        Where the curtains never fall on our shared scenes.</p>

        <p>One-sided feelings,a bittersweet potion,<br />
        Both sipping from the cup of illusion,<br />
        But now, the cup lies shattered,<br />
        Its fragments cutting through the fabric of what once was.</p>

        <p>And so, I linger in the shadows of what was,<br />
        A poet of sorrow, a storyteller of lost dreams,<br />
        In the chapters of us, I find solace,<br />
        In the verses of pain, I find a sad, sweet release.</p>
